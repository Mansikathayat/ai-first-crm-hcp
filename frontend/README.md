# AI-First CRM – HCP Interaction Logging Module

This project is an AI-first CRM module designed to log interactions between field representatives and Healthcare Professionals (HCPs).  
The system supports both **structured form-based logging** and **conversational chat-based logging**, powered by a backend agent architecture.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Medical field representatives often interact with doctors in different contexts.  
This module allows them to log interactions in two flexible ways:

- **Form Mode** – Structured input using predefined fields  
- **Chat Mode** – Conversational input using natural language  

Both modes are processed by the same backend AI agent, demonstrating an **AI-first CRM approach**.
